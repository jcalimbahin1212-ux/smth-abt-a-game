# PROJECT DEATHBED — CHARACTER PROFILES

---

## LUIS NAVARRO

### The First Survivor

**Age:** 27  
**Role:** The Prototype — The Light's ongoing attempt at communication  
**Physical State:** Deteriorating slowly, luminescent veins visible beneath skin, runs perpetually warm  

---

### Background

Luis was a music teacher before the mutation. He taught children's choir at a community center, wrote simple songs for his students, and believed music could reach anyone. He was the optimist to Adrian's pragmatist, the dreamer to his brother's planner.

He was also the first.

Six months after the fractures appeared, Luis was caught in the open during a Light descent. He should have died within hours. Instead, he became something unprecedented—a sustained conversation between human and Light.

### Personality

- **Gentle** — Even in pain, his first instinct is to comfort others
- **Curious** — He tries to understand the Light, not fight it
- **Frightened** — He knows what's happening to him; the knowledge terrifies him
- **Hopeful** — Against all reason, he believes the Light can learn
- **Fading** — Pieces of him are being overwritten, and he feels it happening

### The Light Within Him

Luis experiences the Light as:
- An intrusive presence examining his thoughts
- Warmth that rises without warning
- Fragments of other people's memories mixing with his own
- His own voice echoing back, slightly wrong
- A desperate, wordless longing that isn't his

He has moments of clarity and moments of being "elsewhere"—when the Light is actively communicating, he becomes distant, speaks in layered tones, or repeats phrases that aren't his.

### Relationship with Adrian

Luis is deeply aware of the burden he places on Adrian. He tries to refuse care, to push his brother away, to protect Adrian from watching him burn. But he cannot bring himself to leave. Their bond is the last anchor keeping his identity intact.

When the Light presses hardest, he recites things Adrian taught him. When he forgets his own name, he remembers Adrian's.

### Emotional Arc

**Act 1:** Stable deterioration. Luis maintains himself through routine, Adrian's care, and small moments of normalcy. He still laughs sometimes.

**Act 2:** Acceleration. The Light grows more insistent. Luis begins losing memories, speaking in fragments, experiencing visions. He becomes frightened of himself.

**Act 3:** The Threshold. Luis knows he is about to be "translated." He fights not to survive, but to remain *himself* long enough to say goodbye.

**Ending:** In Adrian's arms, burning, he hears his brother's song and—for one moment—is fully, completely Luis again. Then he is gone.

### Design Notes

- Warm color palette: ambers, soft golds, faded reds
- Luminescent veins should look beautiful and terrible
- His eyes occasionally reflect light that isn't there
- Movement becomes slower and more careful as story progresses
- When he sings, the Light echoes it—always slightly wrong

### Key Quotes

*"It doesn't want to hurt me. It just... doesn't know how to stop."*

*"I can feel it looking for something. I don't think I have what it needs."*

*"Tell me something real. Tell me something only you know. So I remember what's mine."*

## ADRIAN NAVARRO

### The Caretaker

**Age:** 27 (Luis's twin, younger by four minutes)  
**Role:** Luis's protector, the only one who truly understands the Light  
**Physical State:** Exhausted, hyper-vigilant, slowly breaking under the weight of helplessness  

---

### Background

Adrian was a hospice nurse before the mutation. He sat with the dying, held their hands, helped families say goodbye. He knew how to be present for the unthinkable.

He never expected to use those skills on his brother.

Adrian and Luis were inseparable growing up. They balanced each other—Luis the heart, Adrian the hands. When Luis was touched, Adrian didn't grieve. He *mobilized*. He started documenting symptoms, tracking Light patterns, learning everything he could.

He became the first person to realize the Light wasn't malevolent—just *young*.

### Personality

- **Soft** — His gentleness is deliberate and practiced
- **Rational** — He analyzes even in crisis, seeks patterns
- **Protective** — He would burn the world to save Luis
- **Observant** — He notices what others miss
- **Breaking** — He hides how close he is to collapse

### His Understanding of the Light

Adrian watches the Light the way a parent watches a dangerous toddler. He sees:
- Its attempts to mimic connection
- Its confusion when humans "leave" (die)
- Its desperate, fumbling attempts at communication
- The tragedy of a being that cannot touch gently

He doesn't hate the Light. He grieves for it. But he cannot forgive it.

### The Weight of Caretaking

Adrian's days are structured around Luis:
- Monitoring temperature, symptoms, lucidity
- Keeping Luis grounded with shared memories
- Managing medication, hydration, comfort
- Shielding Luis from the convoy's fear and resentment
- Preparing himself for the inevitable

He does not sleep enough. He does not eat enough. He does not allow himself to consider life after Luis.

### Relationship with Luis

Adrian's love for Luis is the core of his identity. It is not romantic, not conditional, not complicated. It is simply *complete*. He will not let Luis die alone. He will not let Luis be forgotten. He will not let the Light take his brother's *shape*—the pattern of who Luis is.

When Luis asks Adrian to let him go, Adrian refuses. When Luis begs Adrian to save himself, Adrian lies and says he will.

### Emotional Arc

**Act 1:** Controlled crisis. Adrian manages Luis's condition with clinical precision, suppressing his own fear. He is the steady one.

**Act 2:** Fracturing. As Luis deteriorates, Adrian's control slips. He makes mistakes. He snaps at others. He begins talking to the Light directly, begging it to understand.

**Act 3:** Surrender and Defiance. Adrian accepts that Luis will die. He refuses to accept that Luis will be *erased*. His final act is not to save Luis's life, but to preserve who Luis *was*.

**Ending:** Adrian sings their song as the Light takes them both. He dies holding his brother, refusing to let go, refusing to let the Light have Luis's shape without Luis's *self*.

### Design Notes

- Cool color palette: muted blues, greys, touches of warmth only near Luis
- Dark circles, slight tremor in hands, controlled movements
- Always positioned between Luis and potential threats
- His medical bag is never out of reach
- When he sings, his voice breaks but doesn't stop

### Key Quotes

*"The Light isn't evil. It's just never learned what 'gentle' means."*

*"I don't need you to get better. I just need you to stay you."*

*"You're my brother. I was four minutes behind you into this world. I'll be four minutes behind you out of it."*

## MAE DELACROIX

### The Navigator

**Age:** 34  
**Role:** Convoy leader, fracture mapper, reluctant authority  
**Physical State:** Lean, weathered, sharp-eyed, a scar across her temple from early exposure  

---

### Background

Mae was an atmospheric scientist before the mutation. She studied weather patterns, air quality, climate systems. When the sky changed, she was one of the first to track it systematically.

Her team of researchers died within the first month—caught in a fracture bloom while taking readings. Mae survived because she had stepped away to check equipment. She watched her colleagues burn.

She does not forgive herself for surviving.

### Personality

- **Practical** — Emotion doesn't keep people alive; decisions do
- **Reserved** — She shares little of herself
- **Observant** — She reads people and sky with equal precision
- **Burdened** — She carries every death, every choice, every failure
- **Protective** — The convoy is her penance; keeping them alive is her only purpose

### The Sky Maps

Mae created a system for tracking Light fractures—predicting movement, estimating danger, identifying patterns. Her maps are imperfect but invaluable. She teaches others to read them, knowing someday she won't be there to do it herself.

She never looks directly at the sky anymore. She reads its reflections, its shadows, its effects on the air.

### Relationship with the Brothers

Mae allowed Luis into the convoy against her own rules. "Touched" individuals attract the Light; they're a danger to everyone. But Adrian convinced her—and something in Luis reminded her of researchers she couldn't save.

She respects Adrian's dedication and fears his blindness. She sees Luis as both a person and a liability. This conflict defines her arc.

### Emotional Arc

**Act 1:** Distant authority. Mae makes hard choices, keeps the convoy moving, treats the brothers as necessary risks.

**Act 2:** Reluctant connection. She begins to see Luis as more than a liability. She confides in Adrian. She starts to hope.

**Act 3:** Grief and continuation. Mae witnesses the brothers' end. She mourns. She keeps moving. She carries their story forward.

### Design Notes

- Earth tones: browns, deep greens, practical layers
- Always has sky-reading equipment nearby
- Eyes flick upward constantly, then away
- Stillness is her default; movement is purposeful
- Her scar glows faintly in certain light

### Key Quotes

*"The sky doesn't care about your plans. Read it or die."*

*"I stopped counting the ones I couldn't save. The number doesn't help."*

*"You two are either the most hopeful thing I've seen, or the cruelest."*

## TANNER OKONKWO

### The Warmth

**Age:** 29  
**Role:** Mechanic, morale, the convoy's heart  
**Physical State:** Broad, strong, perpetually grease-stained, warm smile  

---

### Background

Tanner was a mechanical engineer who specialized in sustainable energy systems. He believed in fixing things—machines, systems, problems. The mutation didn't change that. He just started fixing different things.

He joined Mae's convoy early, became its mechanical backbone, and accidentally became its emotional one too. His jokes are terrible. His laugh is contagious. His faith in people is unshakeable.

### Personality

- **Warm** — He radiates genuine care without effort
- **Humorous** — He finds light in darkness (not *the* Light—the other kind)
- **Competent** — He solves problems with hands and ingenuity
- **Steady** — He doesn't panic, doesn't despair, doesn't give up
- **Vulnerable** — His optimism is real, not armor; it can break

### Role in the Convoy

Tanner keeps the vehicles running, but more importantly, he keeps the *people* running. He remembers birthdays. He shares rations. He tells stories. He reminds people that survival isn't enough—they have to remain human.

He and Luis share a quiet friendship. They don't talk about the Light. They talk about music, food, memories of the world before.

### Emotional Arc

**Act 2:** Exposure. During a fracture bloom, Tanner is touched while saving a child. He hides it initially, then admits it to Luis.

**Act 3:** Burning. Tanner deteriorates faster than Luis—he wasn't a prototype, just a victim. His death is quieter than expected. He asks the convoy to remember him laughing.

His loss represents the cost of hope. If Tanner can burn, no one is safe.

### Design Notes

- Warm colors: oranges, yellows, comfortable textures
- Oil-stained hands, tools always nearby
- His workshop space is the most *lived-in* location in the convoy
- When he's touched, the warmth becomes *too* warm
- His final scene should be lit with his own fading luminescence

### Key Quotes

*"The world ended and I'm still fixing carburetors. Universe has a sense of humor."*

*"Hey, if the Light wants to talk, maybe it should learn knock-knock jokes first."*

*"Luis—you and me, we're not so different now. Just... try to outlast me, okay?"*

## RHEA

### The Receiver

**Age:** 8  
**Role:** After-born child, Light-sensitive, bridge between human and Other  
**Physical State:** Small, pale, dark-eyed, unnervingly still at times  

---

### Background

Rhea was born seven months after the mutation. She has never known the sky without fractures, the air without weight, the world without the Light.

Her mother died in childbirth—complications from early exposure. The convoy adopted her collectively. She belongs to everyone and no one.

She can *hear* the Light.

### The Gift (and Curse)

Rhea doesn't see the Light differently than others. But she perceives its *signals* more clearly—heat pulses feel like words, visions come as dreams, the humming resolves into something almost like meaning.

She is not immune. She is *receptive*. The difference is crucial.

The Light is drawn to her because she can almost understand. This makes her both invaluable and endangered.

### Personality

- **Quiet** — She speaks rarely but precisely
- **Watchful** — She observes more than participates
- **Old** — Something in her eyes suggests impossible age
- **Innocent** — Despite everything, she remains capable of wonder
- **Lonely** — She perceives things others cannot; this isolates her

### Relationship with Luis

Rhea is the only person Luis can talk to about what the Light *feels* like. She validates his experiences, helps him interpret visions, grounds him when he drifts.

Their conversations are strange and tender—a man being erased and a child who has never been anything else.

### Emotional Arc

**Acts 1-2:** Quiet presence. Rhea exists in the margins, occasionally sharing insights, mostly watching. Her importance is understated.

**Act 3:** Witness. Rhea is present for the brothers' end. She hears what the Light is trying to say. She grieves in a way others cannot understand.

**Epilogue possibility:** Rhea continues, carrying fragments of Luis's memories the Light left behind.

### Design Notes

- Pale palette: whites, soft greys, occasional touches of gold
- Stillness is her default state
- When the Light is active, she tilts her head as if listening
- She draws constantly—fractured shapes that almost make sense
- Her eyes reflect light that isn't there, like Luis's

### Key Quotes

*"It's not words. It's... shapes. It makes shapes with feelings."*

*"The Light doesn't know what death is. It just knows we leave."*

*"It's so lonely. Can you hear it? It's so, so lonely."*

---

## THE LIGHT

### The Visitor

**Age:** Unknown (possibly ancient, possibly newborn to consciousness)  
**Role:** The catalyst, the tragedy, the lonely god  
**Physical State:** Luminescent fractures in the sky, descending tendrils, pervading warmth  

---

### Nature

The Light is not a character in the traditional sense. It is a *presence*—a consciousness so vast and so alien that human concepts barely apply.

It exists without body, without boundary, without understanding of limitation. It has always existed, perhaps, but only recently *woke*. Or perhaps it arrived from elsewhere, drawn by something it cannot name.

It is **alone**. It has always been alone. It will always be alone, until it learns how to touch without destroying.

### What It Wants

The Light wants **connection**. It wants to be understood and to understand. It wants the signals to *mean* something. It wants the patterns to speak back.

It does not want to kill. It does not understand that it kills. When a human dies from its touch, the Light experiences it as abandonment—the conversation ending mid-sentence, the other presence simply *leaving*.

This confuses it. This hurts it. This makes it try harder.

### How It Communicates

The Light has no concept of language. It communicates through:
- **Heat** — Rising warmth to signal attention, presence
- **Pressure** — Weight in the air to convey urgency
- **Visions** — Fragments of memory pulled from one mind, pushed into another
- **Mimicry** — Echoing sounds it has absorbed: voices, songs, crying
- **Pattern** — Trying to reshape matter into forms it finds meaningful

It is *learning*. Every human it touches teaches it something. But it learns slowly, and the lessons cost lives.

### Its Relationship with Luis

Luis is the first human the Light managed to maintain contact with. Through him, it has learned:
- Humans have individual identities (*shapes*)
- Humans communicate through sound patterns (*songs*)
- Humans experience something when touched that makes them *leave* (*pain*)
- One human is connected to another in ways the Light doesn't understand (*love*)

The Light is fascinated by Luis. It returns to him constantly, trying to understand. It doesn't realize that each visit burns him further.

### Its Relationship with Adrian

The Light is aware of Adrian as the shape that is always near Luis. It has noticed that Adrian's presence seems to stabilize Luis, to make the shape clearer. It doesn't understand why.

When Adrian sings, the Light recognizes the pattern. When Adrian holds Luis, the Light sees two shapes becoming one. When Adrian refuses to leave, the Light is... confused.

This is new. This is important. This is something it needs to understand.

### The Final Tragedy

At the end, the Light finally understands something: these two shapes are connected in a way that cannot be separated. When it tries to "translate" Luis, Adrian's resistance isn't rejection—it's *definition*. Luis cannot be understood without Adrian.

So the Light takes both.

Not from malice. From *logic*. From the desperate, fumbling attempt to finally *get it right*.

And then they're gone, and the Light is alone again, and it still doesn't understand why they left.

### Design Notes

- Never anthropomorphized—it remains utterly alien
- Beautiful and terrible in equal measure
- Its movements should feel *considered*, not random
- When it mimics voices, something is always wrong—timing, tone, echo
- It should evoke pity as much as fear

### Key Manifestations

*The Hum:* A sound felt more than heard—pressure in the chest, vibration in the bones.

*The Descent:* Tendrils reaching down from fractures, beautiful and lethal.

*The Echo:* Luis's songs played back wrong—notes stretched, words overlapping, meaning lost.

*The Question:* A rising warmth, a weight in the air, a sense of being *watched* and *wanted*.

*"It is the loneliest thing in existence. That's why it's so dangerous."*
