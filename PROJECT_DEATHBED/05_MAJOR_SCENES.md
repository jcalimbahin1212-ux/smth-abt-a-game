# PROJECT DEATHBED — MAJOR SCENES

---

## SCENE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- **Economy of dialogue:** Characters say less than they feel
- **Space for silence:** Pauses carry meaning
- **Environmental reinforcement:** Setting reflects emotion
- **Player presence:** Even in non-interactive moments, the player remains engaged
- **Tenderness in horror:** Even the darkest scenes contain warmth

---

## PROLOGUE SCENES

### SCENE P-1: The Apartment (Evening)

**Setting:** Luis and Adrian's shared apartment, eighteen months before the main story. Warm lamplight, comfortable clutter, the mundane beauty of a shared life.

**Characters:** Luis, Adrian

**Purpose:** Establish the brothers before tragedy; show who they were.

---

**[GAMEPLAY: Interactive exploration of the apartment]**

*The player, as Adrian, moves through familiar spaces.*

*Living room: Luis's guitar, sheet music spread across the coffee table.*
*Kitchen: Half-prepared dinner, Adrian's recipe book open.*
*Window: The first fracture, faint, beautiful, barely noticed.*

**LUIS** (calling from another room)
Adrian, come look at this.

*The player follows Luis's voice to the balcony.*

**ADRIAN**
Dinner's almost—

*He stops. Luis is staring at the sky. The first fracture—a seam of pale gold light—stretches across the darkness.*

**LUIS**
It's beautiful.

**ADRIAN**
(cautious)
What is it?

**LUIS**
I don't know.

*Silence. The brothers watch. The light pulses, slowly, like breathing.*

**LUIS**
I want to see it closer.

**ADRIAN**
Luis—

**LUIS**
Just the roof. Just for a minute.

*[CHOICE: Player can agree, hesitate, or refuse. Any choice leads to the same outcome—Luis goes. The difference is how Adrian feels about not stopping him.]*

---

### SCENE P-2: The Roof (Night)

**Setting:** Apartment rooftop. The sky dominates—the fracture is larger now, brighter. The hum is audible for the first time.

**Characters:** Luis, Adrian

**Purpose:** The moment of exposure; wonder transforming into horror.

---

*Luis stands at the roof's edge, face upturned. Adrian hesitates at the access door.*

**ADRIAN**
Luis, please. Come back inside.

**LUIS**
(not turning)
It's trying to say something.

*The fracture pulses. The hum intensifies. Adrian feels warmth on his face.*

**ADRIAN**
Luis—

*A tendril of light descends. Not fast—slow, curious, reaching.*

**ADRIAN**
(screaming)
LUIS, MOVE—

*Luis turns, finally, but too slow. The light touches him—gently, almost tenderly.*

*Luis's eyes widen. His body stiffens. Light flows into him—through eyes, mouth, skin.*

*Adrian runs forward, grabs Luis, pulls him away. The tendril retracts, as if confused.*

*Luis collapses. Adrian catches him. Holds him.*

**ADRIAN**
(breaking)
Luis. Luis. Stay with me. Stay with me.

*Luis's eyes flutter. They glow, faintly, for a moment. Then focus.*

**LUIS**
(whisper)
It was so lonely.

*[TRANSITION: Fade to white. The hum continues.]*

---

## ACT ONE SCENES

### SCENE 1-A: Morning Ritual

**Setting:** Convoy shelter, dawn. Luis's cot in a partitioned area. Adrian's medical supplies organized nearby.

**Characters:** Luis, Adrian

**Purpose:** Establish the caretaking rhythm; show the tenderness in routine.

---

**[GAMEPLAY: Symptom check tutorial—player examines Luis, notes observations]**

*Adrian crouches beside Luis's cot. Morning light filters through covered windows.*

**ADRIAN**
Hey. How are we today?

**LUIS**
(waking slowly)
Still here.

**ADRIAN**
That's the only answer I need.

*The player performs the morning check: temperature (high, stable), lucidity (clear), tremors (minimal).*

**ADRIAN**
Temperature's the same. You're shaking less.

**LUIS**
Good day?

**ADRIAN**
(small smile)
Good morning, at least.

*Luis sits up slowly. Adrian helps—a practiced motion.*

**LUIS**
Did you sleep?

**ADRIAN**
Some.

**LUIS**
Liar.

**ADRIAN**
Professional hazard.

*A moment of comfortable silence. The brothers, together, in routine.*

**LUIS**
I dreamed about the school. The kids' recital. Remember?

**ADRIAN**
You made them sing that terrible dinosaur song.

**LUIS**
(defending)
They loved that song.

**ADRIAN**
They were seven. They loved everything.

**LUIS**
(soft)
I wonder if any of them made it.

*Adrian doesn't answer. He hands Luis a cup of water.*

**ADRIAN**
Small sips.

*[END SCENE: Player continues morning routine—medication, hydration, grounding exercises.]*

---

### SCENE 1-B: Tanner's Workshop

**Setting:** The convoy's makeshift garage—tools, spare parts, the smell of grease and normalcy.

**Characters:** Luis, Adrian, Tanner

**Purpose:** Introduce Tanner; show warmth and humanity persisting.

---

*Tanner works on an engine. Luis watches, wrapped in a blanket. Adrian hovers nearby.*

**TANNER**
So this kid, right, he asks me—dead serious—if I can fix the sun.

**LUIS**
(amused)
What did you say?

**TANNER**
I said, "Kid, I'm a mechanic, not a miracle worker. But give me enough duct tape..."

*Luis laughs. It's small, weak, but real. Adrian watches, grateful.*

**TANNER**
(to Adrian)
You ever fix anything?

**ADRIAN**
People. Sometimes.

**TANNER**
People are just machines with better PR.

*Tanner wipes his hands, turns to face them both.*

**TANNER**
You two. You're good for this place, you know that?

**ADRIAN**
We're a liability.

**TANNER**
Maybe. But you're also proof that people still take care of each other. That matters.

*He returns to his work. Luis and Adrian share a look.*

**LUIS**
(quiet)
I like him.

**ADRIAN**
Everyone does.

*[END SCENE: Optional dialogue with Tanner—relationship building.]*

---

### SCENE 1-C: Rhea's Drawing

**Setting:** Evening. The convoy gathered for a shared meal. Rhea approaches Adrian.

**Characters:** Adrian, Rhea

**Purpose:** Introduce Rhea's perception; foreshadow her role.

---

*Adrian sits apart from the group, eating mechanically, watching Luis from a distance.*

*Rhea appears beside him. She holds a piece of paper.*

**RHEA**
Adrian.

**ADRIAN**
(startled)
Oh. Hey, Rhea.

*She holds out the drawing. It's abstract—shapes that almost resolve into figures, lines that suggest light.*

**ADRIAN**
What is it?

**RHEA**
It's what the sky sounds like.

*Adrian looks closer. Among the abstract shapes, two forms are clearer: two figures, close together, surrounded by light.*

**ADRIAN**
(careful)
Can you tell me more?

**RHEA**
It's lonely. It keeps trying to talk, but no one listens right.

*She points to the two figures.*

**RHEA**
Except him. It listens to him.

**ADRIAN**
Luis?

**RHEA**
He sounds like a song. That's why it keeps coming back.

*Adrian doesn't know what to say. Rhea takes back her drawing.*

**RHEA**
You sound different. Like... like a circle. Like holding.

*She walks away. Adrian watches her go, unsettled and strangely comforted.*

*[END SCENE: This introduces Rhea's perception and her importance to the narrative.]*

---

## ACT TWO SCENES

### SCENE 2-A: The Wrong Song

**Setting:** Late night. Luis, in a lucid period, hums to himself. Adrian listens from nearby.

**Characters:** Luis, Adrian

**Purpose:** Show Luis's deterioration through something beautiful; establish the central song.

---

*Luis hums a melody—one Adrian knows well. A song from their childhood. Something their mother sang.*

*But something is wrong. Notes stretched. Timing off. The melody *almost* right but not quite.*

**ADRIAN**
(gentle)
Luis.

*Luis continues humming. He doesn't notice.*

**ADRIAN**
(more firmly)
Luis.

*Luis stops. Turns. His eyes are clear—he's present.*

**LUIS**
What?

**ADRIAN**
That song. You were... it was different.

**LUIS**
(confused)
I was singing Mom's lullaby.

**ADRIAN**
It wasn't quite right.

*Luis tries to remember. He hums a few notes—they're correct now.*

**LUIS**
(frightened)
I didn't notice.

**ADRIAN**
I know.

**LUIS**
It's taking things, isn't it? Small things. Things I don't even see leaving.

*Adrian moves closer. Sits beside him.*

**ADRIAN**
Tell me about Mom.

**LUIS**
(shaky breath)
She... she had brown hair. Like ours. She smelled like jasmine. She sang that song when we couldn't sleep.

*As he speaks, he stabilizes. The memory anchors him.*

**ADRIAN**
What else?

**LUIS**
She called you her "little shadow" because you followed me everywhere.

*Adrian manages a small smile.*

**ADRIAN**
Four minutes younger. Eternal follower.

**LUIS**
(grabbing Adrian's hand)
I don't want to forget her.

**ADRIAN**
You won't. That's what I'm here for.

*[END SCENE: Player has reinforced a memory anchor. The scene establishes the song that will return at the climax.]*

---

### SCENE 2-B: Tanner's Confession

**Setting:** Tanner's workshop. Late night. Luis sits with him; Adrian waits outside.

**Characters:** Luis, Tanner

**Purpose:** Two touched individuals share understanding; Tanner's humanity in the face of death.

---

*Tanner shows Luis his arm. Faint luminescent veins are visible under the skin.*

**TANNER**
Happened three days ago. During the bloom.

**LUIS**
(quiet)
Oh.

**TANNER**
Kid I was shielding—she's fine. That's what matters.

*Silence. The weight of shared understanding.*

**LUIS**
Does it hurt?

**TANNER**
Not yet. Just warm. Like standing too close to a fire.

**LUIS**
It gets worse.

**TANNER**
I know.

*Tanner sets down his tools. Looks at Luis directly.*

**TANNER**
How do you do it? Keep going?

**LUIS**
(honest)
Adrian. He won't let me disappear.

**TANNER**
That's lucky. Having someone like that.

**LUIS**
Do you have anyone?

**TANNER**
Had. Lost her before the mutation. Regular apocalypse stuff—car accident, of all things.

*He laughs, bitterly.*

**TANNER**
World ends and I'm still driving too fast.

**LUIS**
I'm sorry.

**TANNER**
Yeah. Me too.

*A moment. Then Tanner smiles—smaller than usual, but real.*

**TANNER**
Listen. I'm not asking you to outlive me for me. I'm asking you to outlive me as proof that it's possible. That people can carry this and still be people.

**LUIS**
I'll try.

**TANNER**
That's all any of us can do.

*[END SCENE: This is the last warm scene with Tanner before his deterioration.]*

---

### SCENE 2-C: Tanner's Departure

**Setting:** The convoy, during a light storm. Tanner lies on a cot, glowing faintly, surrounded by those who loved him.

**Characters:** Tanner, Luis, Adrian, Mae, convoy members

**Purpose:** A death that is not the brothers'; grief and continuation.

---

*Tanner is barely conscious. His skin is translucent; warmth radiates from him. Luis sits closest, holding his hand.*

**TANNER**
(weak)
Did I... did I ever tell you the one about the mechanic and the priest?

**LUIS**
Tell me.

**TANNER**
I forget the punchline.

*He laughs—or tries to. It becomes a cough.*

**MAE**
(from the doorway)
Tanner.

**TANNER**
Mae. Good convoy. Best I've seen. You did good.

**MAE**
(breaking slightly)
So did you.

*Adrian watches from the side. He's seen this before—the final hours. He knows what comes next.*

**TANNER**
(to Luis)
Hey. Remember what I said.

**LUIS**
I will.

**TANNER**
(weaker)
Good. That's... that's good.

*He closes his eyes. His breathing slows. The glow intensifies, then fades.*

*Silence. Then the hum—from outside—rises. The Light has noticed.*

**MAE**
Cover him. Now.

*[GAMEPLAY: The player performs the covering ritual. Materials gathered, body wrapped, words spoken. The Light retreats.]*

*Later. The convoy is quiet. Luis stares at nothing. Adrian sits beside him.*

**LUIS**
That's going to be me.

**ADRIAN**
Not today.

**LUIS**
Soon.

*Adrian doesn't deny it. He takes Luis's hand.*

**ADRIAN**
I'm not going anywhere.

*From outside, the hum fades. But not before it echoes something—Tanner's laugh, almost right.*

*Luis flinches. Adrian holds tighter.*

*[END SCENE: Loss, grief, the Light's incomplete mimicry.]*

---

### SCENE 2-D: Inside the Light (Vision Sequence)

**Setting:** Abstract. Luis's perspective during a vision episode.

**Characters:** Luis (player perspective), the Light (presence)

**Purpose:** Show the Light's perspective; establish its nature; emotional puzzle.

---

**[GAMEPLAY: The player experiences disorientation—inverted controls, fragmented visuals, the hum becoming almost a voice.]**

*The world is shapes. Color that moves. Warmth that speaks.*

*Luis is aware of himself, barely. He floats.*

**THE LIGHT** (not words—impressions)
*Pattern. Movement. Heat-that-signals. You. You stay.*

*Fragments of Luis's memories flash past—his students, Adrian, a song, a sunset.*

**THE LIGHT**
*You are shape. You are repeating. Why do others... stop?*

*An image: other humans the Light has touched. They burned. They stopped.*

**THE LIGHT**
*Why... leave?*

*[PUZZLE: The player must communicate back. Available concepts: WARMTH, PAIN, SHAPE, LOVE.]*

*If the player chooses PAIN:*

*The Light doesn't understand. It presses—images of fire, warmth, energy.*

**THE LIGHT**
*This is... good? Communication. Connection.*

*Luis struggles to convey that warmth can harm.*

**LUIS** (thought)
*Too much. Too much warmth. We break.*

*A pause. The Light considers. Doesn't understand, but... files the information.*

**THE LIGHT**
*You are fragile. I will... try. Less.*

*[OUTCOME: The Light's intensity decreases slightly. Luis's condition stabilizes temporarily.]*

*The vision fades. Luis wakes in Adrian's arms, gasping.*

**ADRIAN**
I'm here. You're here. Stay with me.

**LUIS**
(shaking)
It's trying. It's really trying to understand.

*[END SCENE: Establishes that communication, while dangerous, is possible.]*

---

## ACT THREE SCENES

### SCENE 3-A: Luis's Plea

**Setting:** The convoy's final destination—an abandoned community center. Empty. No salvation.

**Characters:** Luis, Adrian

**Purpose:** Luis accepts his fate; Adrian refuses; the core conflict crystallizes.

---

*Luis stands in the empty building. Windows covered, dust thick, hope absent.*

**LUIS**
This was supposed to be it.

**ADRIAN**
There might be others. Other places.

**LUIS**
(turning)
Adrian.

*Adrian stops. He knows that tone.*

**LUIS**
I can feel it. The Light. It's almost finished with... whatever it's doing.

**ADRIAN**
Then we'll manage. Like we have been.

**LUIS**
I'm losing myself. Pieces are going missing and I don't even know which ones.

*He steps closer. His eyes have a permanent glow now.*

**LUIS**
Tell me who I am. Before I forget.

**ADRIAN**
(breaking)
You're Luis. Luis Navarro. You're twenty-seven. You taught music. You sing—you used to sing—

**LUIS**
Keep going.

**ADRIAN**
You're kind. You're too kind. You see the best in everything, even when there isn't any.

*Tears now, from both.*

**ADRIAN**
You hate mornings. You cry at sad movies. You always burn toast. You're my brother.

**LUIS**
(holding on to each word)
More.

**ADRIAN**
Mom called you her "little light." Ironic now, I guess. Dad taught you guitar when you were eight. You were terrible for years but never quit.

**LUIS**
More.

*Adrian crosses to him. Holds his face. Forces eye contact.*

**ADRIAN**
You are not going to forget. I won't let you. I will tell you who you are every day until—

**LUIS**
Until what?

*Adrian can't finish the sentence.*

**LUIS**
Promise me something.

**ADRIAN**
Anything.

**LUIS**
When it happens—when I'm going—sing to me. That song. Mom's song.

**ADRIAN**
Luis—

**LUIS**
So I know it's really me. So I go as myself.

*Adrian pulls him close. Holds him.*

**ADRIAN**
I promise.

*[END SCENE: The contract is made. The song's importance is sealed.]*

---

### SCENE 3-B: The Night Before

**Setting:** Night. The brothers, alone in a room. Quiet. Waiting.

**Characters:** Luis, Adrian

**Purpose:** The last peaceful moment; everything important said without saying it.

---

*They sit on the floor, backs against the wall, shoulders touching. A candle burns low.*

**LUIS**
Remember that time you broke my guitar?

**ADRIAN**
You swore you'd never forgive me.

**LUIS**
I was twelve. I forgave you by dinner.

**ADRIAN**
You made me do your chores for a month.

**LUIS**
That was the forgiveness.

*A small laugh. Quiet.*

**LUIS**
I'm scared.

**ADRIAN**
I know.

**LUIS**
Not of dying. Of not being me when it happens.

**ADRIAN**
You'll be you. I'll make sure.

*Silence. The hum is distant but present—always present now.*

**LUIS**
Will you stay? At the end?

**ADRIAN**
(no hesitation)
I'm not going anywhere.

**LUIS**
It might take you too.

**ADRIAN**
I know.

**LUIS**
Adrian—

**ADRIAN**
I was four minutes behind you into this world.

**LUIS**
(completing it)
You'll be four minutes behind me out of it.

*Adrian takes Luis's hand. Holds it.*

**ADRIAN**
That's the deal.

*They sit together as the candle burns down. Outside, the Light waits.*

*[END SCENE: Everything is said. Everything is ready.]*

---

*Note: The final confrontation scene is detailed in the Ending Sequence document.*

---

## EPILOGUE SCENE

### SCENE E-1: What Remains

**Setting:** Days later. The convoy, moving again. Mae at the lead.

**Characters:** Mae, Rhea, convoy members

**Purpose:** Life continues; the Light has changed; grief persists.

---

*Mae drives. The road stretches ahead. The sky above is fractured, as always, but... something is different.*

*The hum is quieter. The fractures seem to hesitate.*

**CONVOY MEMBER** (over radio)
Mae, you seeing this?

**MAE**
I see it.

*A Light tendril descends, as usual. But it doesn't reach as far. It hovers, uncertain, then retreats.*

**MAE**
(to herself)
They taught it something.

*Later. The convoy camps. Rhea sits apart, drawing.*

*Mae approaches.*

**MAE**
What do you hear?

**RHEA**
(concentrating)
It's different. Before, it was just... lonely. Now it's lonely and...

**MAE**
And what?

**RHEA**
Sad. It knows it hurt them. It didn't before.

*Mae kneels beside her.*

**MAE**
Does it understand?

**RHEA**
Not really. But it's trying.

*Rhea starts humming. Mae recognizes the melody—Luis's song.*

**MAE**
Where did you learn that?

**RHEA**
(simply)
The Light taught me. It keeps singing it, over and over. Trying to get it right.

*Mae closes her eyes. A tear falls.*

**MAE**
Is it... right yet?

*Rhea listens. Hums another phrase. Then stops.*

**RHEA**
Almost.

*Above, the Light pulses—slowly, gently, like a breath held and released.*

*Mae stands. Looks up. For the first time in months, she doesn't flinch.*

**MAE**
(quiet)
Good.

*The convoy moves on. The Light watches. The world remains.*

*[END SCENE: Grief, continuation, the faintest hope.]*

---

*"They didn't save the world. They didn't defeat the Light. They just... loved each other until the end. And somehow, that mattered."*
