# PROJECT DEATHBED — GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

1. **Caretaking over Combat** — The player protects through presence, not violence
2. **Choices with Weight** — Every decision has emotional consequences
3. **Tension through Intimacy** — The horror is personal, not spectacle
4. **Failure as Narrative** — "Losing" often tells the most powerful story
5. **Stillness as Mechanic** — Sometimes doing nothing is the right choice

### Genre Classification

- Narrative Adventure
- Emotional Survival
- Environmental Puzzle
- Relationship Simulation

## PRIMARY SYSTEMS

### 1. THE CARETAKER SYSTEM

**Overview:** Adrian's primary role is maintaining Luis's condition—physical, emotional, and psychological. This is not a health bar; it's a relationship.

#### Luis's Condition Meters

**Physical Stability**
- Measured through temperature, visible symptoms, mobility
- Managed through medication, hydration, rest, and cooling methods
- When low: Luis experiences pain, tremors, visible deterioration
- When critical: Luis becomes non-responsive, visions intensify

**Lucidity**
- Represents how "present" Luis is
- Managed through conversation, memory anchors, grounding techniques
- When low: Luis speaks in fragments, confuses identities, drifts
- When critical: Luis speaks in the Light's voice, loses recognition of Adrian

**Shape Integrity**
- The core meter—represents Luis's identity preservation
- Managed through memory reinforcement, emotional connection, refusing erasure
- When low: Luis forgets who he is, memories become corrupted
- When critical: Luis begins "translating" into the Light's pattern

#### Caretaking Actions

| Action | Effect | Resource Cost |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Symptom Check | Reveals current status | Time |
| Administer Medication | Stabilizes temperature | Medical supplies |
| Hydration | Slight temperature reduction | Water rations |
| Cooling Compress | Significant temperature reduction | Clean cloth, water |
| Conversation | Improves lucidity | Energy |
| Memory Anchor | Improves shape integrity | Emotional investment |
| Rest | Recovers energy, passive stability | Time |
| Physical Contact | Improves all meters slightly | Nothing—always available |

#### The Care Economy

Resources are limited. Time is limited. Adrian cannot do everything. The player must prioritize:
- Does Luis need physical care or emotional care right now?
- Is it more important to keep him stable or lucid?
- Should resources be saved for later, worse moments?

**Key Tension:** Improving one meter often comes at the cost of another. Medication helps stability but can reduce lucidity. Intense memory work strains Luis physically.

---

### 2. THE MEMORY ANCHOR SYSTEM

**Overview:** Luis's identity is fragmenting. The player helps preserve it by collecting and reinforcing "anchors"—specific memories that define who Luis is.

#### Collecting Anchors

Throughout the game, the player discovers anchor opportunities:
- **Conversation fragments:** Luis mentions something from his past
- **Environmental cues:** Objects that trigger memories (music sheets, photographs)
- **Shared moments:** Present experiences that echo the past
- **Other characters:** Tanner, Rhea, Mae share their perceptions of Luis

When an anchor is discovered, it's added to Luis's Memory Map.

#### The Memory Map

A visual representation of Luis's identity:
- **Core Memories:** Childhood, family, defining moments
- **Skill Memories:** Teaching, singing, caring for others
- **Relationship Memories:** Moments with Adrian, friends, students
- **Self-Concept Memories:** Who Luis believes he is

Each memory is represented as a node. Connections between nodes form Luis's "shape."

#### Reinforcing Anchors

During lucidity-focused care sessions, the player can:
1. Select a memory anchor
2. Adrian prompts Luis to remember
3. Luis responds—sometimes clearly, sometimes fragmented
4. The player helps complete the memory through dialogue choices

**Successful reinforcement:** The memory solidifies; Shape Integrity improves.
**Partial reinforcement:** The memory persists but becomes slightly distorted.
**Failed reinforcement:** The memory corrupts or is lost.

#### The Final Choice

By Act 3, the player has shaped which memories Luis retains most strongly. This affects:
- What Luis says in his final moments
- Which song fragments he can still recognize
- Whether he knows Adrian at the end

---

### 3. THE SKY NAVIGATION SYSTEM

**Overview:** The convoy must travel through territory where Light fractures shift and descend. The player helps navigate.

#### Mae's Fracture Maps

Before each journey segment, the player consults Mae's sky maps:
- **Fracture positions:** Where Light is currently active
- **Predicted movement:** Where fractures are likely to shift
- **Safe windows:** Time periods with reduced activity
- **Terrain options:** Routes with more or less cover

The player helps choose the route, balancing:
- Speed (reaching safety quickly)
- Safety (avoiding fracture zones)
- Resources (fuel, cover availability)
- Luis's condition (some routes are smoother than others)

#### Active Navigation

During travel sequences:
- **Observation:** Watch the sky for fracture changes
- **Decision points:** Quick choices when conditions change
- **Stillness moments:** Everyone must freeze when Light descends
- **Emergency maneuvers:** Quick rerouting during fracture blooms

#### Stillness Mechanic

When Light descends close enough to detect movement:
1. Screen prompts stillness
2. All player input must stop
3. A rhythm meter appears—match breathing pattern
4. Duration varies based on Light proximity
5. Any input during stillness risks detection

**Detection consequences:**
- Light investigates the area
- Must wait longer or reroute
- In extreme cases, convoy members are touched

---

### 4. THE LIGHT COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

**Overview:** The Light attempts to communicate. Sometimes, the player can attempt to understand—or be understood.

#### Vision Sequences

When Luis experiences visions, the player enters a **perception shift**:
- Visuals become abstract, symbolic, alien
- The Light presents fragments of meaning
- The player must interpret

**Interpretation mechanics:**
- **Pattern recognition:** Identify repeating elements
- **Emotional resonance:** Select feelings that match the vision
- **Memory linking:** Connect visions to Luis's anchored memories

#### Communication Puzzles

In key story moments, the player can attempt direct communication with the Light:

**Input:** The player selects from:
- Heat (intensity of feeling)
- Pattern (rhythm, repetition)
- Shape (form, structure)
- Echo (reflection, memory)

**Output:** The Light responds with shifted visuals and sounds.

**Goal:** Achieve mutual recognition—the Light understands something, even if it's small.

**Failure states:** Miscommunication leads to:
- Vision intensity increases
- Luis's condition worsens
- The Light becomes "confused" and more active

#### Rhea as Translator

In some sequences, Rhea can help interpret:
- She provides hints about what the Light might mean
- She can suggest communication approaches
- Her insights improve puzzle outcomes

### 5. THE CONVOY RELATIONSHIP SYSTEM

**Overview:** The brothers exist within a community. Relationships affect story outcomes and available options.

#### Trust Levels

Each major character has a trust level with Adrian:
- **Mae:** Affects convoy decisions, access to resources
- **Tanner:** Affects morale, provides unique interactions with Luis
- **Rhea:** Affects Light interpretation, provides insights
- **Supporting members:** Affects overall convoy dynamics

#### Building Trust

Trust increases through:
- Dialogue choices that show understanding
- Actions that prioritize the community
- Sharing resources appropriately
- Respecting boundaries and decisions

#### Trust Consequences

High trust provides:
- More dialogue options
- Access to resources and information
- Support during crises
- Favorable story outcomes

Low trust results in:
- Limited options
- Tension during key scenes
- Possible exile from the convoy
- Harsher story outcomes

#### The Luis Factor

The convoy's relationship with Luis is complicated:
- They fear what he carries
- They respect his dignity
- They understand the danger he represents

Player actions that protect Luis may conflict with convoy safety. This tension is intentional.

## SECONDARY SYSTEMS

### Resource Management

**Supplies tracked:**
- Medical (medication, bandages, cooling materials)
- Water (drinking, cooling, cleaning)
- Fuel (convoy movement)
- Food (rationing)
- Miscellaneous (tools, paper, comfort items)

**Acquisition:**
- Scavenging during stops
- Trading with other survivors
- Gifts from trusted relationships

**Usage philosophy:** Scarcity creates choices. The player should never feel comfortable.

---

### Dialogue System

**Structure:** Branching conversation with timed and untimed segments.

**Types:**
- **Open dialogue:** Explore topics at leisure
- **Timed responses:** Quick decisions during stress
- **Silence option:** Choosing not to speak is always valid
- **Memory prompts:** During anchor reinforcement

**Impact tracking:** Key choices are remembered, affect later scenes, alter relationships.

---

### Environmental Storytelling

**Discovery mechanics:**
- Found documents (journals, research notes, letters)
- Environmental details (graffiti, abandoned spaces)
- Audio logs (rare, significant)
- Visual narrative (what the environment suggests)

**Integration:** Environmental discoveries can become memory anchors, provide gameplay hints, or enrich world understanding.

---

### Time System

**Structure:** Days pass, marked by routines.

**Time-sensitive elements:**
- Luis's condition changes daily
- Fracture patterns shift
- Events are scheduled

**Player agency:** Some activities consume time. Choosing how to spend a day matters.

---

## UNIQUE MECHANICS

### The Wrong Song

**When it occurs:** The Light mimics Luis's music, imperfectly.

**Player experience:**
- A song plays—almost right, but wrong
- The player can identify what's changed
- Identifying the errors connects to Luis's memory state

**Significance:** As Luis deteriorates, he becomes less able to hear the wrongness. The player may notice before he does.

---

### Covering the Dead

**When it occurs:** After a death in the convoy.

**Ritual mechanics:**
- The body must be covered completely
- Specific materials must be gathered
- Words must be spoken (player choice)
- The covering must be done before the Light notices

**Purpose:** Provides closure, prevents Light attraction, builds community.

---

### Adrian's Journal

**Function:** In-game documentation that the player updates.

**Contents:**
- Symptom tracking (player notes)
- Memory map status
- Relationship observations
- Personal reflections (optional entries)

**Narrative purpose:** Creates artifact of Adrian's perspective; can be referenced later.

---

### The Hum

**Passive awareness mechanic:**
- A subtle audio presence when Light is nearby
- Grows louder as proximity increases
- Player learns to "read" the hum

**Uses:**
- Early warning during navigation
- Tension building in quiet scenes
- Signal of incoming vision sequences

---

## DIFFICULTY AND ACCESSIBILITY

### Difficulty Philosophy

PROJECT DEATHBED is not about challenge; it's about experience. "Difficulty" adjusts friction, not story.

### Accessibility Options

- **Narrative mode:** Reduced resource pressure, easier stabilization
- **Full experience:** Standard balance
- **Immersive mode:** Increased resource scarcity, longer stillness requirements

### Emotional Content Warnings

- Accessible content warnings at game start
- Option to preview emotionally intense scenes
- Skip functionality for specific content types

---

## FAILURE STATES

### Philosophy

There is no "game over." There are only different outcomes.

### Luis Dies Early

If the player fails to maintain Luis's condition:
- Luis's death is earlier, less meaningful
- Adrian's arc shifts to grief and continuation
- The ending is harsher but complete

### Convoy Exile

If relationships collapse completely:
- The brothers leave the convoy
- The story continues but with fewer resources and allies
- The ending is lonelier

### The Light Takes Luis

If Shape Integrity reaches zero before Act 3:
- Luis is "translated" early
- Adrian is not present
- The ending is tragic without the tenderness

### Optimal Path

If all systems are managed well:
- Luis remains himself until the final moments
- Adrian is present, singing, holding him
- The ending is tragic but *complete*

*"This game is not about winning. It's about staying present until the end."*
