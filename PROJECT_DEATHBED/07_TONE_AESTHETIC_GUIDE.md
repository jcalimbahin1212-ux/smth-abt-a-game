# PROJECT DEATHBED — TONE & AESTHETIC GUIDE

---

## THE SOUL OF THE GAME

PROJECT DEATHBED is, at its heart, a love story. Not romantic love—something older, simpler, and more devastating. The love between siblings. The love of a caretaker for the cared-for. The love that says: *I will stay with you until the end.*

Every creative decision must serve this emotional truth.

---

## TONE PILLARS

### 1. INTIMATE, NOT EPIC

**DO:**
- Focus on small moments: a hand held, a breath shared, a song remembered
- Keep the camera close, the spaces contained
- Make the world feel fragile and temporary
- Let silence carry weight

**DON'T:**
- Sweeping vistas meant to show scale
- Battle sequences or action set pieces
- Grand speeches about saving the world
- Heroic sacrifices framed as victorious

**Example:** The convoy isn't a battle convoy—it's a caravan of tired people trying to survive. There are no weapons. There are only covered windows and whispered warnings.

---

### 2. TRAGIC, NOT EDGY

**DO:**
- Allow grief to be quiet and enduring
- Frame death as loss, not spectacle
- Give characters time to mourn
- Let sadness exist without resolution

**DON'T:**
- Graphic violence or gore
- Characters who embrace nihilism
- "Gritty" dialogue meant to sound tough
- Tragedy used for shock value

**Example:** Tanner's death is sad because we loved him, not because it was gruesome. He dies asking people to remember him laughing. That's tragic. A brutal death scene would be edgy.

---

### 3. HUMAN, NOT CYNICAL

**DO:**
- Show people helping each other
- Allow hope to exist, even when it fails
- Give characters genuine warmth
- Let relationships be meaningful

**DON'T:**
- Universal distrust as default
- Characters who only care about themselves
- Humanity depicted as inherently cruel
- Relationships that exist only to be betrayed

**Example:** Mae is guarded, but not callous. She protects the convoy because she believes people are worth protecting, even though she's been hurt before.

---

### 4. ATMOSPHERIC, NOT ACTION-FORWARD

**DO:**
- Let scenes breathe
- Use environmental storytelling extensively
- Prioritize mood over momentum
- Allow the player to simply *be* in spaces

**DON'T:**
- Pacing driven by constant threat
- Gameplay loops centered on combat or escape
- Time limits that create artificial urgency
- Noise for the sake of stimulation

**Example:** Exploration should feel like being in a quiet museum after hours, not an escape room with a countdown.

---

### 5. THE LIGHT IS SYMPATHETIC

This is crucial. The Light is not evil. It is lonely, confused, and lethal *because* of its innocence, not despite it.

**DO:**
- Frame the Light as tragic
- Show its attempts at communication as genuine
- Let characters express pity for it
- Make its behavior curious, not malicious

**DON'T:**
- Monster framing: lurking, hunting, stalking
- Malevolent intent or cruelty
- The Light as something to defeat
- "Scary" design language that implies evil

**Example:** When the Light mimics Tanner's laugh after his death, it's not mockery—it's a clumsy attempt to preserve something it found beautiful.

## VISUAL DESIGN

### Color Philosophy

| Category | Palette | Emotional Association |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Safety** | Muted ochres, dusty blues, warm browns | Home, comfort, humanity |
| **The Light** | Pale gold, soft amber, blinding white | Beauty, danger, loneliness |
| **Warning** | Intensifying yellows, washed-out whites | Escalation, proximity, overwhelm |
| **Grief** | Deep burgundy, soft grey, faded black | Loss, memory, continuation |
| **Luis** | Warm ambers, faint internal glow | Humanity persisting, slow burn |
| **Adrian** | Cool blues, touches of warmth near Luis | Steadiness, devotion, restraint |

### Visual Principles

**Softness over Sharpness**
- No hard edges in light sources
- Diffused shadows, gradual transitions
- The world should feel *gentle*, even when dangerous

**Practical Lighting**
- Candles, lanterns, filtered sunlight
- The Light should be the only source of harsh illumination
- Interiors should feel lived-in and warm

**Transparency and Visibility**
- Luis's condition shown through gradual transparency
- Veins glowing beneath skin
- Internal light visible through silhouettes

**Stillness and Dust**
- The world is paused, waiting
- Dust motes in light beams
- Empty spaces that suggest absence, not abandonment

---

## AUDIO DESIGN

### Soundscape Philosophy

Sound in PROJECT DEATHBED is **presence**, not atmosphere. Every sound should feel *there*, in the room with the player.

### The Hum

The Light's primary audio signature. Not a sound—a *feeling*.

**Characteristics:**
- Low frequency, felt in the chest
- Rises and falls like breathing
- Becomes almost musical at peak intensity
- Present throughout the game, varying in proximity

**Emotional Use:**
- Distant hum = safety, but also isolation
- Close hum = danger, but also connection
- Overwhelming hum = climax, transformation

### Music

**Sparing Use**
- Most scenes are ambient, diegetic sound only
- Score reserved for key emotional moments
- Music should feel like an intrusion—meaningful because rare

**Instrumentation**
- Solo voice
- Simple strings (cello, viola)
- Sparse piano
- The song (Mom's lullaby) is the primary motif

**The Song's Variations:**
- Luis's memory: warm, nostalgic, slightly imperfect
- Adrian's singing: raw, breaking, desperate
- The Light's echo: stretched, wrong, trying
- Final version: correct, pure, grief

### Voice Direction

**General:**
- Quiet, naturalistic delivery
- Allow pauses and silence
- Voices should feel tired, not dramatic

**Luis:**
- Gentle, warm, increasingly fragile
- Layered with Light presence in later stages
- Occasional distant quality, as if speaking from far away

**Adrian:**
- Soft but firm
- Control masking fear
- Breaking only in key moments

**The Light:**
- When speaking through Luis: hollow, echoing, curious
- Never threatening—always questioning

## WRITING GUIDE

### Dialogue Philosophy

**Less is More**
- Characters say what they mean, but briefly
- Subtext carries weight
- Silence is a valid response

**Emotional Honesty**
- No posturing or tough-guy banter
- Fear is admitted; love is expressed
- Characters are vulnerable

**No Exposition Dumps**
- Information emerges through conversation
- The player pieces things together
- Mystery is allowed to remain

### Example Dialogue Styles

**Wrong:**
> "The Light has been transforming people since the mutation. It absorbs their consciousness and uses their bodies as vessels. We have to stop it before it takes everyone."

**Right:**
> "It doesn't understand what it's doing. It just wants to talk. It doesn't know we break."

---

**Wrong:**
> "I've been tracking its movements for months. Based on my data, I can predict where it will strike next."

**Right:**
> "Watch the sky. See how it hesitates near the water? It doesn't like reflections. Maybe it's looking for something it won't find."

---

### Narrative Voice

When text appears (journals, found documents, on-screen text), it should:
- Be personal, not clinical
- Contain emotional truth
- Feel like a real person wrote it

**Example Journal Entry:**
> *Day 47. Luis remembered Mom's birthday today. I didn't prompt him. He just said, "She would have been 63." Then he went back to staring at the wall. I don't know if that's progress or just randomness. I don't know what anything means anymore.*

## EMOTIONAL BEATS GUIDE

### How Grief Should Feel

- Heavy, but not drowning
- Present in small moments, not dramatic outbursts
- Allowed to coexist with warmth and humor
- Never exploited for reaction

### How Fear Should Feel

- Ambient, not acute
- About loss, not death itself
- Tied to identity and connection
- Respected, not dismissed

### How Love Should Feel

- Quiet and practical
- Expressed through action, not declaration
- The foundation of everything
- Never questioned—only tested

### How Hope Should Feel

- Fragile and precious
- Sometimes wrong
- Worth having anyway
- Not separate from grief

---

## THINGS TO ABSOLUTELY AVOID

### Tropes to Exclude

❌ **"Mercy killing"** — Luis is not put down; he is held
❌ **Last-minute cures** — Hope is not about survival
❌ **Heroic sacrifice** — Adrian doesn't die *for* Luis; he dies *with* him
❌ **The Light is defeated** — There is no victory
❌ **Cynical survivors** — No one says "humanity is the real monster"
❌ **Gratuitous suffering** — Pain has purpose, not spectacle
❌ **Jump scares** — The Light is dread, not shock
❌ **Grimdark aesthetics** — This world is sad, not edgy
❌ **"Strong" characters who don't feel** — Everyone here is allowed to cry

### Tonal Pitfalls

❌ **Nihilism** — The story believes in love, even if it's tragic
❌ **False hope** — Hope should be genuine, even when it fails
❌ **Emotional manipulation** — Earn grief, don't manufacture it
❌ **Misery tourism** — The player should feel *with* the characters, not *at* them
❌ **Spectacle death** — Deaths should be quiet and devastating

---

## THE FINAL TEST

Every scene, every line, every visual choice should pass this test:

> **"Does this honor the brothers' story? Does it respect their love? Does it allow the Light to be tragic instead of evil? Does it make me feel something real?"**

If the answer is no, reconsider.

## CLOSING PHILOSOPHY

PROJECT DEATHBED is not about the end of the world. It's about the end of *a* world—the world where Luis exists, where Adrian's purpose makes sense, where the Light is still learning.

The game should leave players:
- Devastated but not destroyed
- Grateful for what they witnessed
- Thinking about who they would hold at the end
- Understanding that some things are worth the cost

Make it quiet. Make it warm. Make it devastating. Make it matter.

*"This is a game about holding on. Not to life—to each other. When everything else burns away, that's what remains: the holding."*
