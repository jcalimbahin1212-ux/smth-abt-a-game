### Core Premise

> The atmosphere has mutated. Strange fractures of living light appear in the sky—shifting, humming, moving with sentient intention. The Light is not evil. It is lonely. It attempts to communicate with humans, but its touch is lethal.

> Luis is the first victim who survives long-term exposure. Adrian, his twin brother, is his caretaker. Their bond is the emotional spine of this story.

> This is not a game about defeating a monster. It is a game about holding someone you love until the end.

### The Central Song

At the climax, Adrian sings to Luis as the Light overtakes him:

*"My story, my history*  
*I held the hope of being free*  
*The love that would hold me*  
*I promised care for thee*  
*I've told you I'm sorry*  
*I was just too careless..."*

### Design Philosophy

- **Caretaking over combat**
- **Intimacy over spectacle**
- **Tragedy without cruelty**
- **The Light is lonely, not evil**
- **Love persists, even when everything burns**

---

*"They didn't save the world. They didn't defeat the Light. They just loved each other until the end. And somehow, that mattered."*
