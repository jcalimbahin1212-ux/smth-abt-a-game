# PROJECT DEATHBED — WORLD BIBLE

## THE MUTATION

### What Happened

The atmosphere did not disappear. It *changed state*.

Approximately eighteen months before the story begins, fractures appeared in the sky—not tears, not holes, but living seams of luminescence. Scientists initially theorized atmospheric ionization, solar interference, or magnetic pole shifts. None of those explanations survived the first week.

The Light is not radiation. It is not energy in any cataloged form. It behaves with intention. It moves. It pauses. It *watches*.

The mutation was not an apocalypse. It was a visitation.

## THE LIGHT

### Nature

The Light is a **sentient phenomenon**—a consciousness without a body, without context, without experience of physical limitation. It exists as shifting luminescence that fractures across the sky in veins, pools, and drifting tendrils.

It is:
- **Curious** — It observes constantly, drawn to movement, sound, and pattern.
- **Lonely** — It seeks connection desperately, reaching toward anything that signals life.
- **Inexperienced** — It has no concept of pain, death, or the fragility of flesh.
- **Non-malicious** — It does not hate. It does not hunt. It simply does not understand.

### Behavior Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Drifting** | Slow, aimless movement across the sky. Safe to observe briefly. |
| **Pulsing** | Rhythmic brightening—an attempt at communication. Moderate danger. |
| **Descending** | Tendrils reaching downward toward sources of sound or movement. High danger. |
| **Fracturing** | Sudden splits across the sky, like lightning frozen in place. Extreme danger. |
| **Mimicking** | Echoing sounds it has absorbed—songs, voices, crying. Deeply unsettling. |

### Communication Attempts

The Light tries to speak through:
- **Heat pulses** — Warmth that rises and falls in rhythmic patterns
- **Visions** — Fragmented images pressed into the minds of those it touches
- **Memory echoes** — Pulling memories from one person and projecting them to another
- **Sound mimicry** — Repeating words, songs, or cries it has absorbed, always slightly wrong
- **Pattern recreation** — Attempting to reshape matter to match shapes it finds beautiful

The Light does not understand that its touch kills. When a human dies from exposure, the Light perceives it as the human *leaving*—abandoning the conversation.

## LIGHT EXPOSURE

### Stages of Infection

**Stage 1: Contact**
- Initial exposure through eyes, lungs, or open wounds
- Warmth spreading through the chest
- Brief euphoria followed by disorientation
- Duration: Minutes to hours

**Stage 2: Integration**
- The Light begins "reading" the body's signals
- Fever, tremors, luminescent veins visible under skin
- Intrusive thoughts, fragments of others' memories
- Duration: Days to weeks

**Stage 3: Conversation**
- The Light attempts active communication
- Visions become constant, overwhelming
- Internal heat causes tissue damage
- The host begins losing memories, identity fragments
- Duration: Weeks to months

**Stage 4: Translation**
- The Light tries to "translate" the host into something it can understand
- Body temperature exceeds survivable limits
- Skin becomes translucent, organs visible
- The host speaks in layered voices
- Duration: Hours to days

**Stage 5: Departure**
- Complete internal incineration
- The host "burns out" from the inside
- The Light moves on, confused, still lonely
- Duration: Instantaneous

Luis exists in a prolonged **Stage 3**, making him unique—a prototype the Light returns to repeatedly, trying to perfect its communication.

## THE WORLD

### Environmental Changes

**The Sky**
- Never fully dark anymore; a perpetual twilight glow
- Fractures visible at all hours, shifting position slowly
- Stars obscured behind luminescent haze
- Weather patterns disrupted—rain is rare, replaced by dry, warm winds

**The Air**
- Heavier, thicker, carrying a faint metallic taste
- Sounds travel differently—echoes last longer, distances deceive
- Occasionally warm without source, as if the Light is nearby

**The Land**
- Urban areas largely abandoned
- Infrastructure decaying but intact
- Nature neither thriving nor dying—suspended
- Shadows behave strangely near Light fractures

### Visual Design Language

**Color Palette**
- Primary: Muted ochres, dusty blues, faded greens
- Accent: Pale gold (the Light), soft amber (warmth/safety)
- Warning: White-gold intensifying to blinding pale yellow
- Emotional: Deep burgundy (blood, sacrifice), soft grey (grief)

**Lighting**
- Always diffused, rarely harsh shadows
- Interiors lit by candlelight, lanterns, covered windows
- The Light itself should feel *soft* until it becomes dangerous
- Warmth should feel threatening, not comforting

**Architecture**
- Covered windows, blocked skylights, improvised shelters
- Vehicles modified with covered canopies
- Mirrors avoided (they attract the Light)
- Everything feels temporary, makeshift, fragile

## SOCIETY POST-MUTATION

### Survival Adaptations

**Travel**
- Only at dawn and dusk when fractures are least active
- Convoy system with covered vehicles
- Scouts watch the sky through filtered lenses
- Complete stillness required when Light descends

**Shelter**
- Underground preferred but rare
- Buildings with minimal windows
- Reflective surfaces covered or removed
- Sound dampening prioritized

**Communication**
- Whispering culture developed
- Written notes preferred over speech
- Songs forbidden in most communities (they attract the Light)
- Hand signals for urgent messages

### Social Changes

- Communities are small, insular, distrustful
- "Touched" individuals (exposure survivors) are often exiled
- Children born post-mutation are called "After-born" and treated with suspicion and reverence
- Caregivers are the most valued members of society
- Death rituals involve covering the body completely—the Light is drawn to the newly dead

## RULES OF THE WORLD

### Physical Laws

1. **The Light cannot pass through dense matter** — Earth, stone, thick metal provide protection
2. **The Light is drawn to pattern and rhythm** — Music, heartbeats, repetitive motion attract it
3. **The Light does not see darkness** — It perceives heat signatures, movement, sound
4. **Mirrors amplify Light presence** — Reflective surfaces act as beacons
5. **Water diffuses the Light** — Rain is protective; bodies of water are sanctuaries
6. **The Light remembers** — It returns to places and people it has "touched"

### Narrative Laws

1. **The Light is never the villain** — Frame it as tragic, not evil
2. **Violence cannot solve this** — There is no weapon against loneliness
3. **Connection is dangerous** — The closer you are to someone, the more the Light notices
4. **Silence is safety but also isolation** — Survival comes at the cost of humanity
5. **Memory is identity** — Losing memories means losing self
6. **Love persists** — Even when everything else burns away

## THE CONVOY

The player's primary setting is a small convoy of survivors traveling toward rumored safe zones, constantly evading active Light fractures.

**Composition:**
- Three modified vehicles with covered cargo areas
- Approximately twelve survivors at story's start
- Mobile but vulnerable—always in transit, never truly safe

**Culture:**
- Mae leads with quiet authority
- Decisions made collectively but quickly
- Resources shared but scarce
- New members rare and scrutinized
- The brothers (Luis and Adrian) are both protected and feared
